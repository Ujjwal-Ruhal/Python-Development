"Radha Krishna(The Eternal Love)"

Slowly, gently let’s dive into the world,
The secret romantic world of Radha and Krishna.
Yellow garments covering Krishna’s body of blue,
Radha’s countenance blushing like the timid silver moon,
With the luring notes of Krishna’s magical flute.

Krishna, who steals from his sanguine eyes,
The precious love deep rooted in the heart inside.
When he stole a glance at Radha’s hazel eyes,
Desire and Love melted to one in two hearts,
And two souls entwined together to form a name ”Radha-Krishna”.

No one near but the white moon above,
In whose milky beams, Love bathes with the doves,
Witnesses the romantic melody of the tranquil night,
That dances out of Krishna’s flute, graceful and divine,
And on the tune of which Radha droops her eyes meekly. 

On the leafy grass, Krishna on Radha’s lap,
In the dark infinite, stars on cloud’s arm,
No eyes have got the boon to get such blissful sight,
Only jingling of Radha’s anklets and notes from Krishna’s flute,
Can feel this spiritual romance of Radha and Madhava.
 
Krishna’s tempting eyes doing the trick,
Calling Radha’s tempted lips to give a kiss,
And like a desert nomad’s thirsty throat in an oasis,
Krishna’s lips keep on drinking the winy kiss from Radha’s lips,
Which drowns his heart in the flooding river of kiss.

This secret world of spiritual love and divine romance,
The sweet of whose nectar soothes the moon and the stars,
What wondrous beauty is hidden in its bosom ?
Where Radha and Madhava , in different conjoining postures,
Come together to fulfill every lustful desire…
