<h1>Cognifyz ( Internship for Python Development )</h1>
<h2> Python Development - Task List </h2>

<pre>
Welcome to the Python Development Internship Program!
You are required to complete any 2 out of 3 levels (Level 1, 2, or 3). These levels are designed to suit your schedule and make the learning journey engaging and rewarding.

Note: Completing any one task from Level 3 can improve your chances of receiving a stipend.
<h3>Now, let's get started with the tasks!</h3>
</pre>
<h1>Level-1</h1>
<pre><h3>Task-1: String reversal</h3>
Create a Python function that takes a string as input and returns the reverse of
that string .
Eg. if the input is "hello" the function should return "olleh".
</pre>

<pre><h3>Task-2: Temperature Conversion</h3>
Create a Python program that converts temperatures between " Celsius and Fehrenheit ". Prompt the user to enter a temperature value and <br/>the unit of measurement , and then display the converted temperature.
Eg. A simple Python program to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.  
The user inputs a temperature and the program displays the converted value.
</pre>

<pre><h3>Task-3: Email Validator</h3>
Develop a Python function that validates whether a given string is a valid email address. Implement checks for the format, <br/> including the presence of an "@" symbol and a domain name
Eg. ujjwal@gmail.com --> valid emailId , test@.com --> Invalid emailId

</pre>

<pre><h3>Task-4: Calculator Program</h3>
Create a Python program that acts as a basic calculator. It should prompt the user to enter two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /, %), and then display the result of the operation.
Eg. A simple Python calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
It prompts the user for two numbers and an operator, then displays the calculated result.
</pre>

<pre><h3>Task-5: Palindrome Checker</h3>
 Write a Python function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward (e.g., "madam" or "racecar")
This Python program defines a function is_palindrome(text) that checks if a given string is a palindrome.
It first converts the string to lowercase, removes spaces, and then compares it with its reversed version.
If both are the same, it returns True; otherwise, False.

<h1>Level-2</h1>

<pre><h3>Task-1: Guessing Game</h3>
Write a Python program that generates a random number between 1 and 100. The user should then try to guess the number.
The program should provide hints such as "too high" or "too low" until the correct number is guessed.
This Python program is an interactive number guessing game.
The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it.
After each guess, the program tells the player if the guess is too high or too low, encouraging them to try again.
When the correct number is guessed, the game congratulates the player and displays the total number of attempts taken.

</pre>

<pre><h3>Task-2: Number Guesser</h3>
Create a number guessing game where the program generates a random number between a specified range, and the user tries to guess it. Provide feedback to the user if their guess is too high or too low.
This Python program allows the user to play a number guessing game within a range they choose.
The user first enters a lower and upper limit, and the program randomly selects a number in that range.
The player repeatedly guesses the number, receiving feedback such as "Too high" or "Too low" after each attempt.
When the correct number is guessed, the program congratulates the player and displays the total number of attempts taken.

</pre>

<pre><h3>Task-3: Password Strength Checker</h3>
Create a Python function that evaluates the strength of a password entered by the user. Implement checks for factors such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
** Checks five factors: ** 
-> Length ≥ 8
-> Contains uppercase
-> Contains lowercase
-> Contains digit
-> Contains special character (from string.punctuation)
-> Counts how many checks are passed.
Classifies the password as Weak, Moderate, or Strong.

<pre><h3>Task-4: Fibonacci Sequence</h3>
Write a Python function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms. 
The function should take an integer input from the user and display the Fibonacci sequence up to that number of terms.
This Python program generates the Fibonacci sequence for a user-specified number of terms. 
It starts with [0, 1], then calculates each new term by adding the previous two. Special cases (n ≤ 2) are handled separately to prevent errors, and the complete sequence is printed for the given term count.
like that...
</pre>

<pre><h3>Task-5: File Manipulation</h3>
Write a Python program that reads a text file and counts the occurrences of each word in the file. 
Display the results in alphabetical order along with their respective counts.
This Python program reads a text file, removes punctuation, and converts all words to lowercase for uniform counting. 
It then counts how many times each word appears using a dictionary and displays the results in alphabetical order. 
If the file does not exist, it shows an error message instead of crashing.
